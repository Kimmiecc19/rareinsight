This guide introduces trusted online resources that help patients, families, and clinicians better understand genetic test results and rare disease information.

> **Disclaimer:** Always interpret genetic results with the help of a clinical geneticist.

## 1. ClinVar: Interpreting Genetic Variants

**ClinVar** is a free resource which helps explain if a variant is harmful (pathogenic) or harmless (benign).  

ClinVar shows:  
- Variants submitted by clinical labs and researchers  
- Their clinical significance (e.g., benign, uncertain, pathogenic)  
- Related conditions and their level of evidence  

| Classification         | What It Means                        |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Pathogenic             | Causes disease                       |
| Likely Pathogenic      | Strong evidence of disease link      |
| Uncertain Significance | Unknown effect                       |
| Likely Benign          | Likely harmless                      |
| Benign                 | Harmless                             |

## 2. gnomAD: Understanding Variant Frequency

**gnomAD** is a population database that shows how common a genetic variant is among large groups of healthy people.

- If a variant is **very common** in the general population, especially among healthy individuals, it is unlikely to cause a rare genetic disease.
- If a variant is **very rare** or missing in the general population, it may be more likely to be associated with a rare disease.

### Dominant vs. Recessive Conditions

In genetics, "dominant" and "recessive" describe how different versions of a gene (called **alleles**) affect traits.

- A **dominant allele** shows its effect even when only **one copy** is inherited.  
- A **recessive allele** needs **two copies** (one from each parent) to show its effect.

Here’s an easy-to-understand comparison:

| Feature               | **Dominant Trait**                                  | **Recessive Trait**                                           |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **What it means**     | Trait shows if **one copy** of the gene is changed | Trait shows **only if both copies** of the gene are changed  |
| **Who has the trait** | Anyone with just **one changed gene**              | Only people with **two changed genes**                        |
| **Carriers**          | Not applicable                                     | Carriers have **one copy** of the change, but no symptoms     |
| **Passed down from**  | One parent                                         | Both parents                                                   |
| **Examples**          | Brown eyes, dimples                                | Blue eyes, albinism, cystic fibrosis                          |

> *A carrier* is someone who has a gene change but does not have the condition. They can still pass it on to their children.

### So, what is considered rare in the general population?

| Frequency              | Interpretation                                             |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Very rare (<0.01%)     | Could be linked to rare diseases                           |
| Common (>1%)           | Often harmless (especially for dominant conditions)        |

## 3. NORD: Rare disease support

**NORD** provides simplified information and connects patients to communities and support groups.

Their mission is to *improve the health and well-being of people with rare diseases* by driving advances in care, research and policy.

As a patient or caregiver, you can:  
- Read summaries of rare conditions  
- Find advocacy groups  
- Learn about treatments and clinical trials  
- Get access to some helpful [resources](https://rarediseases.org/resource-library/)

---

## 4. GARD: Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center

**GARD** is an NIH site with expert-reviewed information about rare and genetic diseases.

- Searchable by condition (use our RareInsight Search Panel)  
- Easy explanations of inheritance and testing  
- Lists of research and care [resources](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/resources)

---

## 5. GeneReviews: Expert Clinical Summaries

**GeneReviews** contains in-depth summaries of genetic conditions written by doctors.

- Useful for clinicians and advanced learners  
- Covers inheritance, symptoms, and testing  
- Regularly reviewed and updated

---

## 6. PubMed: Scientific Research Database

**PubMed** is a searchable database of medical and scientific publications.

- Useful for finding studies about specific genes or variants  
- Look for review articles or case studies related to your condition

> Tip: Use the gene name or disorder in the search bar to find relevant studies (e.g., “BRCA1 mutation breast cancer”).

---

## 7. LitVar: Scientific Literature for Variants

**LitVar** connects specific genetic variants to related research articles.

- Useful for tracking what's been published about a variant  
- Shows links between variants, diseases, and studies

> It is best used with a variant ID (like NM_ or rs number).

---

## 8. OMIM: Inheritance and Gene-Disease Relationships

**OMIM** (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) links genes to inherited conditions.

- See how a gene is related to a disease  
- Learn about inheritance patterns and symptoms  
- Check references to scientific literature

> OMIM is a powerful tool for understanding how a gene affects health and what to expect.

---

## 9. Varsome: Variant Aggregator and Classifier

**Varsome** brings together data from ClinVar, gnomAD, dbSNP, and more.

- Gives automated variant classifications  
- Aggregates multiple sources  
- Suggests whether a variant is likely harmful

> Varsome is helpful for combining several perspectives in one place, but final interpretation should be done by a clinical expert.

---

## 10. dbSNP: Variant IDs and Annotations

**dbSNP** is a database of known genetic variants.

- Each variant has a unique ID starting with "rs" (e.g., rs123456)  
- Good for looking up basic information about a known SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism)

> dbSNP does not tell you if a variant is harmful — it’s a registry, not a clinical tool.

---

## How to access these resources on RareInsight:

- Go to the **Search Panel**  
- Search for a **disorder, gene, variant, dbSNP accession, or ClinVar accession**  
- Go to the **Diagnostic Report** panel  
- Click on the resource you would like to access

> Please note that each resource indicates which search term is required. For example, PubMed will work if you search for a gene, while NORD works if you enter a disorder.

## Final Thoughts

These databases and resources provide powerful clues for interpreting genetic information. But genetics is complex, and no single resource is enough on its own.

> Always consult a **genetic counselor**, **medical geneticist**, or **clinician** when interpreting genetic test results.
