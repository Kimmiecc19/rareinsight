### Allele
Variants of a gene at the same chromosome location. Some alleles affect function, like those in the BRCA1 gene.

### Cell
The basic unit of life. Contains structures like the nucleus that hold DNA.

### Chromosome
Bundles of DNA. Humans have 46 (23 pairs). Abnormalities can lead to disorders.

### *De novo* variant
De novo variants are new variants that have appeared for the first time in a patient instead of being inherited. Often they are just caused by chance.

### Diagnostic Genomic Test
A test that uses DNA to confirm or rule out a diagnosis.

### Diagnostic Odyssey
The long journey patients face before receiving a correct diagnosis.

### DNA
The molecule that carries your genetic code. Made up of four bases: A, T, C, G.

### Double Helix
The twisted-ladder shape of DNA that allows it to replicate.

### Exome
The part of the genome that codes for proteins (about 2%).

### Gene
A section of DNA that provides instructions for a protein.

### Genetics
The study of genes and inheritance.

### Genome
All the DNA in an organism, including genes and non-coding regions.

### Mutation
Any change in DNA. Some mutations may cause disease.

### Next-generation Sequencing
Fast, high-throughput methods for sequencing DNA or RNA.

### Phenotype
Your observable traits (e.g., eye colour, disease symptoms).

### Sequencing
Reading the order of DNA bases.

### Variant
A difference in the DNA sequence. Some cause disease; others do not.
