RareInsight: Developing a rare disease report generator for clinicians and patients

# Abstract
The scarcity of knowledge surrounding rare diseases underscores the critical necessity for collaborative research efforts to unravel their complexities and improve diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes. This research introduces RareInsight, an effort focused on developing an open-source, interactive dashboard tailored for clinicians and patients. Its primary objective is to transform the interpretation of genetic variant data into flexible and detailed reports, aiming to ease rare disease diagnosis and research.

RareInsight will be designed to process genetic variant data into customizable, interactive reports. These files are preferably generated by nf-coreâ€™s raredisease pipeline as it employs some level of filtering and prioritization from whole genome or whole exome sequencing data. The resulting VCF files will be used as input into the dashboard which is equipped with advanced filtering options, statistical analysis capabilities, and diverse export formats, empowering users to explore detailed data and seamlessly collaborate with peers for further analysis and interpretation. The final interactive dashboard will be developed using Shiny and tested using rare disease data from esteemed sources such as the Undiagnosed Disease Program and NHGRI GREGOR Consortium datasets found in dbGaP.

By encapsulating clinical relevance, genetic implications, ACMG classification, and essential resources within these reports, RareInsight will aid in informed decision-making for both clinicians and patients. Employing visual aids such as charts and graphs will further enhance comprehension and clarity. RareInsight will eliminate the proprietary limitations often present in existing tools. By adopting an open-source environment, it strives to encourage transparency and customization tailored to specific clinical or research requirements. The dashboard will also prioritize stringent data privacy and security measures to ensure the protection of sensitive genetic data.

Overall, this dashboard thrives on collaboration, by allowing researchers and clinicians to seamlessly share and collaborate on reports, fostering knowledge exchange and enriching the collective understanding of rare diseases. In essence, RareInsight is poised to redefine rare disease diagnosis and research by inviting collaboration and innovation to enhance healthcare outcomes in an open-source format.
