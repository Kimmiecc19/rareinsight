## What is Genetics?

**Genetics** is the study of how traits are passed from parents to children.  
**Genomics** is the study of the entire genome and how it's used.

## What Makes Up Our Genome?

- Your genome is made of DNA and stored in 23 pairs of chromosomes.
- Humans have about 20,000 protein-coding genes.
- Genes give instructions to build proteins that form and repair our bodies.

## How Do We Study the Genome?

- Sequencing reads the 3 billion base pairs in your DNA.
- A full genome sequence can produce ~200 GB of data.
- A team of professionals interprets the results alongside clinical history.

## How Do We Get These Variants?

- You inherit one gene from each parent (2 copies in total).
- Most of your DNA is the same as others â€” but the small differences (variants) can matter.
- Some variants are harmless, while others may cause disease.
- For example, some variants give us our physical traits such as height.
