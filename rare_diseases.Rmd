## What Are Rare Diseases?

- A rare disease affects fewer than 1 in 2,000 people.
- Over 7,000 rare diseases exist.
- 80% are genetic
- 70% of rare diseases start in childhood.

> While individually rare, together they affect 3.5-5.9% of people worldwide.
> In [Africa](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-022-02391-w), there is a lack of reliable data on how many people are affected, but it is estimated to be around **50 million**. That's around 1 in 25 Africans!

## The Diagnostic Odyssey

Patients often have to go through:
- Years of unanswered questions
- Seeing multiple specialists
- Having countless, sometimes unnecessary, tests
- A lack of treatment or support even after a diagnosis

## How Are Genetic Conditions Inherited?

- **Single Gene Conditions** – Caused by changes in one gene  
- **Chromosome Conditions** – Caused by missing or extra chromosomes  
- **Multifactorial Conditions** – Involve many genes and the environment

## Types of Inheritance

### Dominant

- One changed gene copy is enough
- 50% chance of passing to each child

### Recessive

- Two changed copies are needed
- Parents are usually carriers

### X-linked

- Mutations on the X chromosome
- Affects males more often
